# bundesrat-beratungsvorgaenge

This is a Python-based webscraper for collecting data on all public sessions of the German Bundesrat (Federal Council). 

The information it scrapes is available here: http://www.bundesrat.de/DE/dokumente/beratungsvorgaenge/2016/beratungsvorgaenge-node.html

More specifically, it collects information on the unique identifier of the session ("Beratungsvorgang") and on the committee(s) involved in the decision-making. 

The data should be of interest to scholars of political science and public administration.

I've done this little project as a favor for a colleague working on the German Bundesrat and a small exercise for my webscraping skills.
